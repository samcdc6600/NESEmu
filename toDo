# Priority of list is from top to bottom, with the top being the highest.

* GENERAL ======================================================================
  	- Consider using Doxygen for documentation!
	- Fix problems when compiling with g++!
	- Improve error messages for debug commands.
	- Improve code for "handlePrintHelp()"
	- Make variables for parts of duplicated debug commands exception out
	  put's in utils.cpp?
	- Fix error where non char type numbers read in with
	  "getNumbersFromStrInHex()" that are less then 0 are read even if the
	  type is not signed.
	- (LOW PRIORITY) Convert debug consol output to use ncurse. This way we
	  can take advantge of pretty colours to help distinguish things.

* CPU ==========================================================================
	- Implement instructions.
	- See if code to set carry in "cmp_c9()" can be replaced with
	  "setCarryFlagOnAdditionOn()" or why we would need both if that is the
	  case.

* .NES ROM loading =============================================================
        - ...
