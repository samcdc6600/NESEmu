# Priority of list is from top to bottom, with the top being the highest.

* GENERAL ======================================================================
	- Consider using raw string for output handlePrintHelpCommand()
	- Fix problems when compiling with g++!
	- Improve error messages for debug commands.
	- Handle escape sequences in code included in doxygen documentation
	  that is run through modifyHTMLDocsToCollapseCode.sh, e.g. "\n" is
	  interprited as an escape sequence rather then being displayed!
	- Improve code for "handlePrintHelp()"
	- Make variables for parts of duplicated debug commands exception out
	  put's in utils.cpp?
	- Fix error where non char type numbers read in with
	  "getNumbersFromStrInHex()" that are less then 0 are read even if the
	  type is not signed.
	- (LOW PRIORITY) Convert debug consol output to use ncurse. This way we
	  can take advantge of pretty colours to help distinguish things.

* CPU ==========================================================================
	- Implement instructions.
	- See if code to set carry in "cmp_c9()" can be replaced with
	  "setCarryFlagOnAdditionOn()" or why we would need both if that is the
	  case.

* .NES ROM loading =============================================================
        - ...


* PPU ==========================================================================
	- Mapper for Kirby's Adventure (Not explicitly related to the PPU but we
	  will need it to run the game.)
	- ...


* APU ==========================================================================
	- ...


* Mappers ======================================================================
  	- ...

* GUI ==========================================================================
	- Make GUI for emulator (useing imGUI!)
