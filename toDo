# Priority of list is from top to bottom, with the top being the highest.

* GENERAL ======================================================================
	 - Fix issue with ambiguous from "checkStrNumber()", this is somewhat
	   related to the next item.
	- Change command handling code to use tokens and allow arbitrary white
	  space (we think it is okay right now, but it's a little ridgid.)
	- (LOW PRIORITY) Convert debug consol output to use ncurse. This way we
	  can take advantge of pretty colours to help distinguish things.


* CPU ==========================================================================
	- Think about whether to put the function bodies in "instructions.hpp"
	  into their own .cpp file and make an extra hader file with the name
	  spaces and such from the start of "cpu.cpp" to be included into the
	  new .cpp file for the function bodies from "instructions.hpp". Think
	  about wheather this extra complixity is worth it.
	- Finish "plp_28()".
	- Update comment for "checkStrUnsignedNumber()".
	- Implement instructions.


* .NES ROM loading =============================================================
