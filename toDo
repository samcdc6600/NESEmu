# Priority of list is from top to bottom, with the top being the highest.

* GENERAL ======================================================================
	- Make  modifyHTMLDocsToCollapseCode pass shellcheck.
	- Add instruction specialization descriptions to the top of instruction
	  specialization functions in instructions.hpp that do not currently
	  have them.
	- Fix problems when compiling with g++!
	- Alter code for setting breakpoints so that you can set a brakpoint for
	  the line you are on.
	- Improve error messages for debug commands.
	- Improve code for "handlePrintHelp()"
	- Make variables for parts of duplicated debug commands exception out
	  put's in utils.cpp?
	- Fix error where non char type numbers read in with
	  "getNumbersFromStrInHex()" that are less then 0 are read even if the
	  type is not signed.
	- Try to make instructions.hpp shorter as there is a lot code
	  duplication in the implementation of the instruction specializations.
	- (LOW PRIORITY) Convert debug consol output to use ncurse. This way we
	  can take advantge of pretty colours to help distinguish things.
	- (LOW PRIORITY) fix problem with modifyHTMLDocsToCollapseCode.sh that
	  causes code in the "See source" section that is too long too not fully
	  display.
	- (LOW PRIORITY) fix problem with modifyHTMLDocsToCollapseCode.sh that
	  causes newlines in the "See source" section to be interprited as
	  newliens.

* CPU ==========================================================================
	- Implement instructions.
	- See if code to set carry in "cmp_c9()" can be replaced with
	  "setCarryFlagOnAdditionOn()" or why we would need both if that is the
	  case.

* .NES ROM loading =============================================================
        - ...


* PPU ==========================================================================
	- Mapper for Kirby's Adventure (Not explicitly related to the PPU but we
	  will need it to run the game.)
	- ...


* APU ==========================================================================
	- ...


* Mappers ======================================================================
  	- ...

* GUI ==========================================================================
	- Make GUI for emulator (useing imGUI!)
