# Priority of list is from top to bottom, with the top being the highest.

* GENERAL ======================================================================
	- Fix problems when compiling with g++!
	- Improve error messages for debug commands.
	- (LOW PRIORITY) Convert debug consol output to use ncurse. This way we
	  can take advantge of pretty colours to help distinguish things.


* CPU ==========================================================================
	- Think about whether to put the function bodies in "instructions.hpp"
	  into their own .cpp file and make an extra hader file with the name
	  spaces and such from the start of "cpu.cpp" to be included into the
	  new .cpp file for the function bodies from "instructions.hpp". Think
	  about wheather this extra complixity is worth it.
	- Finish "plp_28()".
	- Implement instructions.


* .NES ROM loading =============================================================
