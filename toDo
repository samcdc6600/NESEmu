# Priority of list is from top to bottom, with the top being the highest.

* GENERAL ======================================================================
	- (LOW PRIORITY) Convert debug consol output to use ncurse. This way we
	  can take advantge of pretty colours to help distinguish things.
	- Change command handling code to use tokens and allow arbitrary white
	  space (we think it is okay right now, but it's a little ridgid.)


* CPU ==========================================================================
	- Think about whether to put the function bodies in "instructions.hpp"
	  into their own .cpp file and make an extra hader file with the name
	  spaces and such from the start of "cpu.cpp" to be included into the
	  new .cpp file for the function bodies from "instructions.hpp". Think
	  about wheather this extra complixity is worth it.
	- Finish implementing "handleAlterMemoryCommand()"
	- Finish "plp_28()".
	- Add initial catch to "printMemeory()" and "alterMemory()" to catch
	  throw that we shal add to checkStrNumber to check that maximum range
	  of number isn't out.
	- Update comment for "checkStrUnsignedNumber()".
	- Implement instructions.


* .NES ROM loading =============================================================
        - ...


* PPU ==========================================================================
	- Mapper for Kirby's Adventure (Not explicitly related to the PPU but we
	  will need it to run the game.)
	- ...
