# Priority of list is from top to bottom, with the top being the highest.

* GENERAL ======================================================================
	- Fix problems when compiling with g++!
	- Improve error messages for debug commands.
	- Improve code for "handlePrintHelp()"
	- Make variables for parts of duplicated debug commands exception out
	  put's in utils.cpp?
	- Fix error where not char type numbers read in with
	  "getNumbersFromStrInHex()" that are less then 0 are read even if the
	  type is not signed.
	- (LOW PRIORITY) Convert debug consol output to use ncurse. This way we
	  can take advantge of pretty colours to help distinguish things.

* CPU ==========================================================================
	- Implement instructions.
	- Finish implementing new debug commands. Remember that commands that
	  don't have any arguments should have a slightly different pattern to
	  their "handleXCommand()" functions.
